## Welcome

This is the Qiskit Fall Fest 2023 event page for an Italian university, in Trieste, Italy. We're so excited to have you all here. The event is being hosted at the Università degli Studi di Trieste. 

Qiskit Fall Fest aims to create awareness about Quantum Computing so we can inspire many people to engage with this new Era and create a better solution for a better world.  

The Qiskit Fall Fest is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout September to design and plan their events, which are then run in October or November. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all to help to grow the local community’s skill set.

The Fall Fest at UniTs this year is going to be an in-person conference and some workshops starting on November 15th, Wednesday, 2023, In person. Details about the event and rules can be found below. The deadline for registration is November 14th. We are looking forward to seeing you at the event!
